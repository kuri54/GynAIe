**GynAIe**: Pronounced "Genie" (/ˈdʒiːni/)  
The name **"GynAIe"** is a blend of **"Gynecology"** and **"AI"**. We've chosen to pronounce it as "Genie" (/ˈdʒiːni/) to emphasize the magical assistance it provides in the field of gynecology.

## 🙇🏻‍♂️ Note to Users
Please be advised that this project is managed solely by me. As such, updates to the code and responses to issues may take some time. I appreciate your patience and understanding as I work to make this project as useful and robust as possible. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome and highly valued.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

## ✨ Highlights
- Developed an AI-integrated workflow for cervical cytology screening that reduces screening time to approximately 10 seconds per case and significantly lessens the workload on cytologists.
- Implemented a visual language model that enhances the identification of high-risk cases by prioritizing cases based on anomaly scores and targeting review efforts accordingly.
- Demonstrated the potential of AI technology to improve the efficiency and accuracy of cytological examinations, contributing to faster diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer.
