**"Magical AI for women worldwide."**

**GynAIe**: Pronounced "Genie" (/Ààd íiÀêni/)  
The name **"GynAIe"** is a blend of **"Gynecology"** and **"AI"**. We've chosen to pronounce it as "Genie" (/Ààd íiÀêni/) to emphasize the magical assistance it provides in the field of gynecology.

## üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Note to Users
Please be advised that this project is managed solely by me. As such, updates to the code and responses to issues may take some time. I appreciate your patience and understanding as I work to make this project as useful and robust as possible. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome and highly valued.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

## ‚ú® Highlights
- Developed an AI-integrated workflow for cervical cytology screening that reduces screening time to approximately 10 seconds per case and significantly lessens the workload on cytologists.
- Implemented a visual language model that enhances the identification of high-risk cases by prioritizing cases based on anomaly scores and targeting review efforts accordingly.
- Demonstrated the potential of AI technology to improve the efficiency and accuracy of cytological examinations, contributing to faster diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer.

## Usage
It is recommended to use a virtual environment of your choice, such as Docker.

### Generating Tile Images
Access this [link](https://github.com/kuri54/Preprocessing-WSI) to generate tile images from WSI (Whole Slide Image).  
This process can also be done on a local machine, but the processing speed will depend on the CPU performance.  
<br>
The tile images in the paper were generated with the following parameters:  
```bash
python preprocessing.py -u 0.3 -s 1024  
```
<br>

**More usage instructions will be updated periodically. Please generate the tile images and stay tuned!**
